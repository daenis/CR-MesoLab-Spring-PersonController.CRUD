/**
 * The Controller is responsible for handling HTTP calls.

 * A Controller holds endpoints, which are associated with methods. When a client (Angular app, Postman, CURL, etc)
   submits an HTTP request to the server url (ex: http://localhost:8080), the application is able to register specific
   endpoints. For example, by submitting a GET request to (http://localhost:8080/api/majors), one will execute the
   findAllMajors() method.

 * In addition to accepting the HTTP request, a controller will typically return some type of data. However, it is not
   the controller's job to retrieve said data; the controller simply requests the data via a service method. The
   responsibilities are decoupled; the controller listens for a request, calls to the service and returns the result
   as a response entity. It's up to the service to execute any business logic. The controller isn't concerned with
   how the service retrieves the information; only that the data is retrieved.

 * All rest controllers must be annotated with @RestController

 * The @RequestMapping(value = "/api/majors") defines a base URL at the class level; every method's associated endpoint
   URL will have this prefixed. (ex: "/{id}" endpoint -> "/api/majors/{id}"

 * */
